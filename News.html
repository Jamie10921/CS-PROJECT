		<h3> Social Media in Our Modern World </h3>

			According to Google Dictionary, social media is defined as “websites and applications that enable users 
			to create and share content or to participate in social networking.” <br>

			<br> Almost everyone nowadays has at least one social media account. 
			Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest are used for day-to-day communication, 
			for entertainment, and even as a form of art. People use these platforms to post their original
			ideas and creations, share their opinions, and even spark movements. 
			Platforms like these are used to build relationships between individuals, 
			helping people easily meet and connect with others. We are able to stay updated with daily news and 
			events and quickly share moments in our lives. Brands are able to easily communicate with clients and 
			receive feedback, making customer service even better. <br>
			
			<img src = "../images/dangers of media.jpg" align = "right" height = "200px">
			
			<br> With all these positive impacts social media brings, we tend to overlook its more negative side. 
			The use of social media leaves anyone able to become a victim of cyberbullying or internet frauds, 
			the younger users being especially susceptible. The younger generation 
			(young adults, teenagers, and even school-age children) tend to waste most of their time on their gadgets, 
			playing games and scrolling through social media, becoming detached from reality. 
			Some have become obsessed, wanting to gain as many followers, likes, and shares as possible, 
			wanting the fame and attention. Some have begun to be affected by how others perceive them, 
			consciously checking how people react to their posts, experiencing FOMO (fear of missing out), 
			and wanting to show the best version of themselves. 
			Seeing everyone else’s perfect photos only makes them feel worse, 
			wondering why their own lives aren’t as perfect. 
			In fact there have been many studies on how social media affects one’s mental health. <br>
	
			<br>In short, social media has many good and bad impacts on our modern world. 
			It is important to use these platforms maturely (always thinking before clicking) 
			and being aware of how you use social media and how it affects your life.
