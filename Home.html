			<p> Social Media (singular: Social Medium) are platforms/programs that can create interactions among people that use these
			media platforms. It usually contains some user-generated content, some of which are texts, comments, posted photos and videos.
			These platforms collect data from their users in order to deliver personal services (such as advertisements, recommended
			activities, etc.)

			<img src="../images/world.jpg" alt="world" style="width:100px; float:left;">
			<p> Most of us want to be known. How do we do that? By two methods. One can be through social interactions with your friends,
			or other people. The other can be through social media. We post our thoughts, pictures, videos and others, for our friends (or
			even the world!) to see. But not all of us get noticed. We tend to feel sad that we see our friends' pictures get more likes
			than our pictures. Because of Social Media, people often compare themselves to what they see and hear online.
